You can access this assignment with the following link: `classroom.github.com/a/<xxxxxxx>`.

For this assignment, work through the tasks in the notebook `GA1.2_taylor_made_approximations.ipynb`. The assignment is split into three parts that are independent from each other.

The first part focuses on numerical integration, based on an example from hydrological data analysis.
The second part is about approximating a function with a Taylor series.
The third part is about using Taylor series to approximate derivatives numerically.

After finishing all tasks in each part, answer the questions in `report.md`. For some of the questions, you can copy your answers from one of the tasks in `GA1.2_taylor_made_approximations.ipynb` directly, for others, some additional reflection is required.

This assignment is still ungraded. You do not need to submit anything.
