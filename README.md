For this assignment, work through the tasks in the notebook `GA1.2_taylor_made_approximations.ipynb`. The assignment is split into three parts that are largely independent from each other.
After finishing all tasks in each part, answer the questions in `report.md`. For some of the questions, you can copy your answers from one of the tasks in `GA1.2_taylor_made_approximations.ipynb` directly, for others, some additional reflection is required.
Your grade for this assignment will be based on your answers in `report.md`.

This assignment is still ungraded. You do not need to submit anything.
