# Group assignment 1.2: Taylor-made approximations

*Due: Friday, September 12, 2025. This assignment is still ungraded. You do not need to submit anything.*

This assignment is split into three parts that are independent from each other:

1. [Numerical integration, based on an example from hydrological data analysis](./1-discharge-numerical-integration.ipynb)
2. [Approximating a function with Taylor polynomials](2-taylor-polynomials-logarithm.ipynb)
3. [Using Taylor series to approximate derivatives numerically](./3-taylor-derivative-approximation.ipynb)

After finishing all tasks in each part, answer the corresponding questions in `report.md`. Often, you can just use your answers from one of the tasks in the notebook directly. But filling in the report template will help you become familiar with the Markdown format that you will use for submission in the following weeks. For some questions, a bit of additional reflection is required.
