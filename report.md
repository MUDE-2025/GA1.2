# Report

## Part 1

**1.1 Briefly summarize how you computed the discharge from the concentration measurements and present your result.
Include the code line(s) that implement the numerical integration.**



**1.2 Justify your choice of numerical integration method, taking theoretical and practical considerations into account.**


**1.3 Paste the plot that you created in task 1.4. How many points would you choose for integrating the simulated concentration curve with Simpson's rule? Justify your answer.**


## Part 2

**2.1 What is the expression for the 4th order Taylor polynomial of $\ln(x)$ around $x_0 = 1$? You can copy a picture of your solution from task 2.1 (or type the solution in Markdown format).**


**2.2 Paste your plot of the Taylor approximations of $\ln(x)$ (output of task 2.5).**



**2.3 How well do the Taylor polynomials approximate the function $\ln(x)$? Consider the influence of the order of the polynomial and the value of $x$ in your answer.**



## Part 3

**3.1 Copy your derivation from task 3.1 here (as a picture or in Markdown format).**
